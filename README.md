## Revisiting Bash shell scripting through project based training

### Project 1 (Creating Local Users)
The goal of this project is to create a shell script that adds users to the same Linux system as the script is executed on.

### Project 2 (Creating Local Users - improved version!) 
This script is an improved version of the previous script: instead of requiring the user for a password we generate one for him. All the needed information for the user account is passed as arguments when running the script.
